## Project

kyara is a CLI (command line interface) in order to automate my daily tasks as a developer.

## Implementation ideas

- [ ] Add new commands.
- [ ] Refactor the code of the existing commands.

## Installation

- **`npm install -g kyara`** or **`yarn global add kyara`**;

**Note:** I recommend that you install **globally**, so you can use it anywhere on your machine and gluegun does not support installation for specific folders.

## Commands

To consult the list of commands just type **`kyara -h`** or **`kyara --help`**. <br>
